## Abstract
This report presents a detailed analysis of the air quality of Odisha, India, for the year 2015.  
The objective of the study is to evaluate the levels of key air pollutants and to identify spatial and seasonal variations across major cities in the state.  
By applying data analysis techniques, the study provides an evidence-based view of Odisha’s environmental condition.

## Introduction
Air pollution poses a significant threat to both human health and the environment.  
In developing regions such as Odisha, rapid industrialization and urban growth have intensified pollution levels.  
This study focuses on assessing the concentration of major air pollutants — **Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)**, **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)**, and **Particulate Matter (PM10)** — using authentic 2015 data.

---

## Methodology
The dataset was obtained from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)** through **data.gov.in**.  
The analysis was conducted using **Python 3.x** in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection:** Retrieval of 2015 air quality data for Odisha.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing or inconsistent values.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding pollutant distributions.  
4. **Visualization:** Creating graphical representations to interpret pollution patterns.  
5. **Result Interpretation:** Deriving insights and forming conclusions.

### Tools and Libraries
- pandas and numpy for data processing  
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook for implementation and documentation

## Data Description
The dataset contains records from multiple monitoring stations across cities in Odisha.  
Each record consists of the following fields:
- **State**, **City**, **Location**
- **SO₂**, **NO₂**, **PM10** concentrations
- **Sampling Date / Year**

---

## Results
The analysis revealed that:
- **PM10 levels** exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in several regions.  
- **NO₂ and SO₂ levels** remained mostly within acceptable limits.  
- Industrial and urban areas such as **Bhubaneswar** and **Cuttack** displayed higher pollution levels compared to rural areas.  
- The **winter season** exhibited the highest particulate matter concentration, consistent with nationwide pollution trends.

---

## Discussion
The findings highlight the importance of regional monitoring and the need for stricter emission controls.  
Odisha, though less industrialized than neighboring states, still faces growing air quality concerns due to increased vehicular and industrial activities.

---

## Conclusion
The study concludes that Odisha’s air quality in 2015 was moderate but deteriorating in specific urban zones.  
To maintain environmental balance, proactive measures such as green zoning, public awareness, and improved emission regulations are recommended.
